Epiphany: Attempted to setup firebase for the dialogflow agent. Following this tutorial:
https://miningbusinessdata.com/firebase-guide-part-1-create-new-dialogflow-agent/
First I logged into console.firebase.google.com.
Then I navigated to Database and selected "Create database" under Cloud Firestore.
Created a collection labeled "users" in the database.
In Dialogflow conosle, setting up a database allowed me to enable the Inline Editor in fulfillment.
I deployed the Inline Editor. _I did all these actions the day before but forgot to leave comment._
